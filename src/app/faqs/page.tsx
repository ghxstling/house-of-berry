          <AccordionContent>
            <p>
              Matcha is a finely ground powder made from specially grown and
              processed green tea leaves. Unlike regular tea where you steep and
              discard the leaves, with matcha you consume the entire leaf,
              maximising its nutritional benefits and delivering a unique, rich
              flavor experience.

            Why is ceremonial grade matcha special?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            <p>
              Ceremonial grade matcha is the highest quality available, made
              from the youngest tea leaves with stems and veins removed. This
              creates a smoother, naturally sweeter flavor without bitterness.
              It&apos;s traditionally used in Japanese tea ceremonies and offers
              the most vibrant color and delicate taste experience.

        <AccordionItem value="item-4">
          <AccordionTrigger>Why choose matcha over coffee?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            <p>
              Matcha provides a different kind of energy boost than coffee. The
              L-theanine in matcha creates a state of calm alertness without the
              jitters or crash that often comes with coffee. Matcha releases
              caffeine more slowly (over 4-6 hours), providing sustained energy
              rather than a quick spike and drop.
