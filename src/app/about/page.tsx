              A fun experience. An act of creativity. A moment of indulgence.

              House of Berry was born from a simple love: the daily ritual of
              matcha. But not just any matchaâ€”matcha made fun, fresh, and
              unexpected. Wanting to break away from the ordinary, we set out to
              reimagine what a morning pick-me-up could be.

              Our drinks are designed to be as exciting as they are refreshing,
              from iced matcha whisked to perfection before your eyes to rich,
              smooth iced lattes crafted from bold flavours.
            </p>

              House of Berry isn&apos;t just about coffee or matcha. It&apos;s
              about turning everyday moments into something special - one sip at
              a time.
