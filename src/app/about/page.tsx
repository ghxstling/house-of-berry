          <p>A fun experience. An act of creativity. A moment of indulgence.</p>
          <p>
            House of Berry was born from a simple love: the daily ritual of
            matcha. But not just any matchaâ€”matcha made fun, fresh, and
            unexpected. Wanting to break away from the ordinary, we set out to
            reimagine what a morning pick-me-up could be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our drinks are designed to be as exciting as they are refreshing,
            from iced matcha whisked to perfection before your eyes to rich,
            smooth iced lattes crafted from bold flavours.
          </p>
          <p>
            House of Berry isn&apos;t just about coffee or matcha. It&apos;s
            about turning everyday moments into something special - one sip at a
            time.
